# Quick-Hull
Given a 2D point-cloud, enclose it with the smallest hull possible in O(n2) time.

Source code on demand.

* For setting up the program, place both the JAR and the input file in the same folder.
* The input file contains the coordinates of the points in the point cloud.
* The input file's contents can be edited as desired, provided they follow the same format (x-y coordinates separated with a space, a line dedicated to each point, values not exceeding 100).
* The input file's name must not be changed.
* Double click on the JAR to start it up.
* Once the JAR is running, press the spacebar key to iterate the process step by step. Each step creates a new line or erases an obsolete line, until the whole point-cloud is enclosed in a hull (convex polygon).
